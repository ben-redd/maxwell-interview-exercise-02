## Repository for Maxwell Interview Exercises

### Tips and best practices

#### 1. Submission

To submit the exercise(s), please push your code to your personal GitHub or any other place where you can share your work with us. **Please DO NOT submit a PR to this repository**

#### 2. Make commits incrementally

Please do not squash commit before submission. We want to see incremental commits.

#### 3. Branch name

When you work on any exercise, choose a branch name that you think would make sense to you.

#### 4. How to approach the problem

Approach this problem as if it is an application going to production.
We don't expect it to be perfect (no production code is), but we also don't want you to hack together a throw-away script.
This should be representative of something that you would be comfortable releasing to a production environment.  

Also, spend whatever amount of time you think is reasonable.
You may use whatever libraries, frameworks and tools that you think are appropriate, just provide any special setup instructions when you submit your solution.

You will not get any extra points for solving the challenge fast. Speed of delivery is not what we are looking for in this challenge.

We are looking for you to demonstrate your knowledge related to common software practices to include reusability, portability and encapsulation - to name a few.

#### 5. No extra points for writing tests for the exercises

If you want to write test for your solutions then please go ahead, but no points will be added for having tests, nor will points be deducted for not having any tests.

#### 6. Time

Your recruiter has provided the deadline in their email so spend as much or as little time on this as you'd like, although we'd typically suggest dedicating a few hours to complete."

#### 7. Programming Languages/Frameworks

It's your choice on which programming language to use, however the Maxwell stack is predominately Ruby/Rails and Javascript/React. If you are applying for a Front End position, consider developing your solution with a browser based UI rather than having it execute as a command line program.
