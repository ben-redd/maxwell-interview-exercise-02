## Exercise QA Automation: A smoke test to verify the landing page functionality

* Implement a test to verify the basic functionality of a Lender's landing page:
  * Using Selenium or any other open source automated testing framework, verify the landing page at https://snap.modernemortgage.com/home/mobile-test
  * Test 1: The page displays an email address for the Lender.
  * Test 2: After clicking the "Apply Now" button, the resulting page displays the same email address as in Test 1.

## Expectations from your solution
* The test/tests you create can be run by someone from the Maxwell team.
  * E.g. A script that can be run from the command line or another application that was used.
* Provide a README with instructions on how to run the automated verification test.
* The "output" should display the success or failure state of each test.
* Provide a screen recording of your tests running that can be viewing by someone from the Maxwell team.
